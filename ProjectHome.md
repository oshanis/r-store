## R-Store ##

**What does this software do?**

Given an RDF store, generate a relational database schema that minimizes the number of nulls while creating Property Tables as wide as possible.

**How does this work?**

We have created a class library which does the conversion, and a sample to test the code with. A video showing a demo of the functionality of this class library is available here.
